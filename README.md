# HeKKSaGOn-GPDS_Projects
This repository includes all the coursework I learned during my HeKKSaGOn-GPDS International Summer School on Data Science 2024 projects. The summer school was an intensive, two-week program that covered advanced topics in data science. The curriculum was designed to provide both theoretical knowledge and practical skills through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and competitive challenges. It covered a wide range of advanced data science topics, including:

1. Introduction to Data Science
2. Data Preprocessing and Exploration
3. Classification Algorithms (Decision trees, random forests, SVM, KNN)
4. Regression Algorithms (Linear, polynomial, ridge, and lasso regression)
5. Ensemble Learning (Bagging, boosting, and stacking methods)
6. Model Optimization (Hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, model selection)
7. Multiclass Classification
8. Data Simplification (Dimensionality reduction techniques: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)
9. Clustering (K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN)
10. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
11. Text Mining & Natural Language Processing
12. Time Series Forecasting (Time series analysis, ARIMA, advanced forecasting)
